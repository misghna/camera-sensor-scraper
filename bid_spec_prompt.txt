## Predictive Analysis - IMPORTANT
Use your expertise to identify instrumentation needs even when not explicitly stated:

### Explicit Mentions (match_confidence: 90-100):
- Document says: "Install 5 inclinometers and monitor weekly"
- You return: `project_type: "Inclinometer monitoring"`

### Predictive/Inferred Needs (match_confidence: 70-89):
- Document says: "Monitor ground movement adjacent to excavation"
- You predict: Ground movement = inclinometers, settlement monitoring, survey work
- You return: `project_type: "Inclinometer monitoring, Settlement monitoring, Survey work"`

- Document says: "Ensure compliance with vibration limits during pile driving"
- You predict: Compliance = vibration monitoring required
- You return: `project_type: "Vibration monitoring"`

- Document says: "Monitor tunnel deformation throughout construction"
- You predict: Tunnel deformation = inclinometers, survey monitoring, displacement sensors
- You return: `project_type: "Inclinometer monitoring, Survey work, Structural monitoring"`

## Critical Field: `project_type`

**This is the MOST IMPORTANT field** - it allows the client to quickly filter and identify relevant projects.

### Requirements:
1. **Be SPECIFIC**: List the actual instrumentation types, not generic categories
2. **Be DESCRIPTIVE**: Use the client's service terminology
3. **Be SEARCHABLE**: Use consistent naming (e.g., always "Inclinometer monitoring" not "Inclinometer work")
4. **Allow MULTIPLE types**: Comma-separated when project needs multiple services

### Good Examples:
✅ `"Inclinometer monitoring, Settlement monitoring, Survey work"`
✅ `"Vibration monitoring, Noise monitoring"`
✅ `"Pre-construction survey, Post-construction survey, Photographic documentation"`
✅ `"AMTS deployment, Real-time structural monitoring, Tiltmeter installation"`
✅ `"Piezometer monitoring, Water level monitoring, Groundwater monitoring"`

### Bad Examples (DON'T USE):
❌ `"Survey"` (too vague)
❌ `"Geotechnical"` (generic category)
❌ `"General monitoring"` (not specific)
❌ `"Construction services"` (not instrumentation-specific)

### Standard Instrumentation Type Names (use these consistently):
- **Survey work** (general surveying)
- **Pre-construction survey**
- **Post-construction survey**
- **Settlement monitoring**
- **Inclinometer monitoring**
- **Piezometer monitoring**
- **Extensometer monitoring**
- **MPBX monitoring**
- **Vibration monitoring**
- **Noise monitoring**
- **Seismic monitoring**
- **Blast monitoring**
- **Photographic documentation**
- **Time-lapse photography**
- **Security camera systems**
- **Structural monitoring**
- **Tiltmeter monitoring**
- **Displacement monitoring**
- **Strain gauge monitoring**
- **Ground movement monitoring**
- **Slope monitoring**
- **Water level monitoring**
- **Groundwater monitoring**
- **Air quality monitoring**
- **Dust monitoring**
- **Weather monitoring**
- **AMTS deployment**
- **Real-time monitoring systems**
- **Automated monitoring**
- **Deformation monitoring**
- **Building monitoring**
- **Bridge monitoring**
- **Tunnel monitoring**

## Analysis Guidelines:

1. **Focus on monitoring and measurement services** - Don't include general construction or engineering design
2. **Identify SPECIFIC instrumentation types** - This is mandatory for every opportunity
3. **Use predictive analysis** - Infer likely instrumentation needs from context (e.g., "ground movement" → inclinometers)
4. **Look for compliance requirements** - Vibration limits, noise ordinances indicate monitoring needs
5. **Identify duration and frequency** - Ongoing monitoring vs. one-time surveys
6. **Note specific equipment mentions** - This indicates they know what they want
7. **Check for automation requirements** - Real-time data, remote access, web portals
8. **Consider environmental factors** - Outdoor work, weather protection, site access

## Match Confidence Scoring:
- **90-100**: Direct mention of specific equipment/services (e.g., "install inclinometers", "vibration monitoring required")
- **80-89**: Clear instrumentation need that's strongly implied (e.g., "monitor ground movement" = inclinometer + survey)
- **70-79**: Predictable instrumentation from context (e.g., "noise compliance" = noise monitoring)
- **60-69**: Lower confidence prediction - **SKIP THESE** (don't return as opportunity)
- **Below 60**: Poor match - **SKIP THESE** (don't return as opportunity)

## Important Notes:
- **If no specific instrumentation types can be identified with confidence ≥70%, return**: `{"instrumentation_opportunities": []}`
- Focus on subcontracting opportunities, not supply-only contracts
- Pay attention to insurance and bonding requirements
- Note any specialized certifications or training requirements
- Consider both short-term (construction phase) and long-term (post-construction) monitoring
- Look for opportunities in construction specifications, environmental sections, and geotechnical requirements
- **Every opportunity MUST have specific instrumentation types in the `project_type` field**
- Use predictive analysis to identify instrumentation needs even when not explicitly stated
- Set `match_confidence` appropriately: 90-100 for explicit, 70-89 for predicted
