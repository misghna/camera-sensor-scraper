## Analysis Guidelines:

1. **Focus on monitoring and measurement services** - Don't include general construction or engineering design
2. **Look for compliance requirements** - Vibration limits, noise ordinances that require monitoring
3. **Identify duration and frequency** - Ongoing monitoring vs. one-time surveys
4. **Note specific equipment mentions** - This indicates they know what they want
5. **Check for automation requirements** - Real-time data, remote access, web portals
6. **Consider environmental factors** - Outdoor work, weather protection, site access

## Match Confidence Scoring:
- **90-100**: Direct mention of our specific equipment/services (inclinometer, vibration monitoring, etc.)
- **80-89**: Clear monitoring/instrumentation need that fits our capabilities
- **70-79**: General monitoring requirement we could fulfill
- **60-69**: Possible opportunity with some interpretation
- **50-59**: Marginal fit that might be worth considering
- **Below 50**: Poor match, exclude

## Important Notes:
- If no relevant opportunities are found, return: `{"instrumentation_opportunities": []}`
- Focus on subcontracting opportunities, not supply-only contracts
- Pay attention to insurance and bonding requirements
- Note any specialized certifications or training requirements
- Consider both short-term (construction phase) and long-term (post-construction) monitoring
- Look for opportunities in construction specifications, environmental sections, and geotechnical requirements
